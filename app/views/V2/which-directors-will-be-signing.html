  <strong>Directors who are people</strong>
  <p>
  Directors must sign the application themselves. Nobody can sign on their behalf.<br> <br>

  Sometimes a director cannot sign – for example, because they no longer have mental capacity. If there are not enough directors who are able to sign, you'll need to make changes to the directors before continuing with this application.

  <strong>Corporate directors</strong>
  <p>
  For directors that are companies, an authorised person must sign on their behalf.
