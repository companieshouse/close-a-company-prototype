  <strong>Directors who are people</strong>
  <p><p>
  Directors must sign the application themselves. Nobody can sign on their behalf.<br> <br>

  Sometimes a director cannot sign. For example, because they no longer have mental capacity. If there are not enough directors who are able to sign, you'll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/file-changes-to-a-company-with-companies-house" class="govuk-link" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">make changes to the company directors (opens in new tab)</a> before continuing with this application. This might include removing a person as a director or appointing a new director</a>.
</p>


  <p>
  <strong>Corporate directors</strong>
  <p>
  For directors that are companies, an authorised person must sign on their behalf.
